# Odin Recipes Project

This project is a part of the Odin Project curriculum. The goal of this 
project is to build a simple recipe website to demonstrate basic HTML 
skills. By the end of this project, I will have demonstrated my ability 
to:

- Create and structure an HTML document
- Use various HTML elements to display content
- Link multiple pages together
- Use images in a webpage
- Apply basic CSS styles (optional, if you plan to style your recipes)

## Project Overview

The website will consist of a main index page that links to individual 
recipe pages. Each recipe page will contain the recipe title, a list of 
ingredients, and step-by-step cooking instructions.

## Skills Demonstrated

- Structuring HTML documents
- Creating hyperlinks
- Embedding images
- Organizing content with lists
- Writing semantic HTML
